# MARCO (Marine and Regional Coastal Ocean) Model)

MARCO is an oceanic modeling system based on ROMS and CROCO, maintained by Indian and French institutes focused on sustainable development, advanced computing, and applied mathematics. A key objective of MARCO is to resolve processes at very high resolution (metric scale) and understand their interactions with larger-scale phenomena. The system incorporates both non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic solvers, ocean-wave-atmosphere coupling, coupled sediment (CSTM/MARS) and marine biogeochemistry model (PISCES). It utilizes fifth-order high-resolution numerical schemes for advection and mixing, as well as a dedicated I/O server and optimized parallel algorithms.
